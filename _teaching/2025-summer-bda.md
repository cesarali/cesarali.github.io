The seamless integration of large data sets into sophisticated computational models provides one of the central research challenges for the mathematical sciences in the 21st century. When the computational model is based on evolutionary equations and the data set is time-ordered, the process of combining models and data is called data assimilation. The assimilation of data into computational models serves a wide spectrum of purposes ranging from model calibration and model comparison all the way to the validation of novel model design principles.

The field of data assimilation has been largely driven by practitioners from meteorology, hydrology and oil reservoir exploration; but a theoretical foundation of the field is largely missing. Furthermore, many new applications are emerging from, for example, biology, medicine, and the neurosciences, which require novel data assimilation techniques.
