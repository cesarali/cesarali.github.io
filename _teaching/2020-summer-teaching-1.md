"The "Grundlagen der Finanzmathematik" course, translated as "Fundamentals of Financial Mathematics", offers a deep exploration into the central tenets of financial math. Beginning with the rudimentary principles, the curriculum seamlessly advances to delve into the valuation of financial derivatives, the intricacies of interest rate models, and the underpinnings of portfolio theory. Central to the course is the Black-Scholes model, where we dissect its assumptions, derivations, and real-world applications. Risk-neutral valuation, hedging strategies, and the Greeks also occupy significant segments, ensuring a holistic understanding of the discipline. Additionally, we touch upon stochastic calculus as it pertains to finance, allowing students to grasp the mathematical robustness behind financial models. While I personally guided the exercise sessions to emphasize practical applications and problem-solving, the lectures are grounded in imparting a rigorous theoretical foundation."
