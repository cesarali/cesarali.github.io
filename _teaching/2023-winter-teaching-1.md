 Beginning with the foundational elements of probability theory, the curriculum delves into the core concepts of learning, various regression models, and the nuanced differences between batch and sequential processing. Advanced topics such as Support Vector Machines, VC Dimension, and Gaussian Processes are seamlessly integrated, ensuring a well-rounded understanding. Techniques like Principal Component Analysis, Autoencoders, and Generative Adversarial Networks highlight the course's depth in the domain. I have the opportunity to lead the exercise sessions and even will jump in for a couple of lectures. While we dive deep into the theory, we're all about hands-on application. The course is jam-packed with exercises to ensure you're not just learning, but actively applying these concepts.
