I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at the University of Potsdam in the Department of Applied Mathematics, where I also serve as AI Advisor for the PharMetrX program, an interdisciplinary initiative at the interface of pharmacometrics and computational disease modeling. Previously, I worked as a Postdoctoral Researcher at the Technical University of Berlin with the group of Prof. Dr. Manfred Opper, and before that as a Doctoral Researcher at Fraunhofer IAIS.

My research goal is to advance machine learning methods that can meaningfully impact the natural sciences and human health. I am particularly fascinated by the interface between statistical inference, stochastic processes, and machine learning. My current work develops foundation models for stochastic dynamics, including Markov jump processes and stochastic differential equations, with applications ranging from molecular simulations and high-energy physics to pharmacokinetics and drug development.

I have a strong interest in approximate inference, Bayesian nonparametrics, optimal transport, and generative modeling, and my earlier work also spanned NLP and graph-based reasoning for large language models. More recently, I am pioneering amortized in-context inference architectures for population-aware pharmacokinetic modeling, aiming to accelerate personalized dosing strategies and bridge mechanistic modeling with state-of-the-art machine learning.
