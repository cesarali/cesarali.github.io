Accurate dose–response forecasting under sparse sampling is central to precision pharmacotherapy. In this talk I will introduce the Amortized In-Context Mixed-Effect Transformer (AICMET), a framework that unifies mechanistic compartmental priors with amortized in-context Bayesian inference. By pre-training on large collections of synthetic pharmacokinetic trajectories with Ornstein–Uhlenbeck priors, AICMET acquires strong inductive biases and can adapt zero-shot to new compounds. The model conditions on early measurements and the collective context of trial participants, enabling calibrated posterior predictions for new individuals within hours instead of weeks.

Beyond the technical details, I want to emphasize the broader opportunities AI brings to pharmacometrics while also pointing to the confusion created by the flood of AI publications. There is enormous potential, but also a clear need for careful development, rigorous validation, and clarity as we explore how these methods can reshape drug development and personalized dosing.
