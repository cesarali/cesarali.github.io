 Wepropose an extended Hawkes process model
 where the self–effects are of both excitatory and
 inhibitory type and follow a Gaussian Process.
 Whereas previous work either relies on a less flex
ible parameterization of the model, or requires
 a large amount of data, our formulation allows
 for both a flexible model and learning when data
 are scarce. Efficient approximate Bayesian infer
ence is achieved via data augmentation, and we
 describe a mean–field variational inference ap
proach to learn the model parameters. To demon
strate the flexibility of the model we apply our
 methodology on data from two different domains
 and compare it to previously reported results.
